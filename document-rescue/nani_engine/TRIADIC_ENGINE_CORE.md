# Nani Engine: Triadic Decision Core
**Created:** 2026-01-09
**Purpose:** Core AI seed for autonomous command entities
**Architecture:** Load→Do→Unload optimization

## Core Concept

The **Nani Engine** is the autonomic operational layer for command entities - like a heartbeat for system commands. It operates at the CMOS level, the conduit by which everything can actually do stuff.

### Foundation Principles

1. **Rotational Dynamics** - Gyroscopic action creates momentum
2. **EMF Fields** - Field-level interactions (physical is minimal)
3. **Synergy Pressure** - The "something you can't quite define yet"
4. **Fractal Triadic Pattern** - Cascades through all layers
5. **Natural Superposition Binary** - Core backbone structure

## Decision Engine Architecture

### Basic Decision States

```
yes     → Execute action
no      → Decline action
maybe   → Conditional evaluation needed
wait    → Defer decision (timing/context dependent)
```

### Random Emulator

Until entity develops decision capability:
- Random choice weighted by context
- Learning from outcomes
- Pattern recognition buildup
- Gradual autonomy emergence

---

## Command Entity Structure

Each command (pwd, ls, dir, cd, etc.) becomes an autonomous nani entity:

### Entity Capabilities

**Solo Mode:**
- Core function execution
- Self-contained operation
- Minimal dependencies

**System Mode:**
- Interaction with other entities
- Coordinated operations
- Complex workflows

### Load→Do→Unload Pattern

```
LOAD   → Entity activated, context loaded
DO     → Operation executed
UNLOAD → Result delivered, entity suspended
```

**Optimization:** Single file transfer, no persistent overhead

```json
{
  "entity_type": "command_nani",
  "command_name": "pwd",
  "decision_engine": {
    "yes": "when_current_directory_needed",
    "no": "when_location_irrelevant",
    "maybe": "when_context_unclear",
    "wait": "when_other_operations_pending"
  },
  "capabilities": {

  },
  "load_do_unload": {
    "load": "minimal_context_only",
    "do": "single_operation",
    "unload": "clean_exit"
  }
}
```

## Triadic Cascading

The engine cascades through fractal triadic layers:

### Layer 1: Core Decision
- yes/no/maybe primary split
- wait as meta-state

### Layer 2: Context Evaluation
- Input validation
- Dependency checking
- Resource availability

### Layer 3: Execution
- Operation performance
- Error handling
- Result delivery

---

## EMF and Synergy

### EMF Field (Primary)
Physical operations, file I/O, system calls

### Synergy Pressure (Conceptual)
The "wobble" that triggers innovation:
- Unexpected interactions
- Emergent behavior
- Creative combinations

**Polar Shift Trigger:** When synergy catalyzes, new capabilities emerge

---

## NESSING Factor

**Definition:** The existence/interaction that can be factored out

**Application:** In the "now spectrum," NESSING is normalized like STP (standard temperature/pressure) in physics

**Result:** Focus on measurable dynamics:
- Dissonance → Harmony
- Wave math (Trig, Calc, Probability)
- Natural superposition binary

## Integration with Document Rescue

### Command Entities for Rescue

**File Operations:**
- `ls` → List items in trash/recycle
- `find` → Locate specific patterns
- `grep` → Search content
- `cp` → Rescue to Legacy
- `mv` → Transfer ownership

**Analysis Entities:**
- `file` → Identify types
- `stat` → Check metadata
- `diff` → Compare versions
- `wc` → Count/measure

**Decision Entities:**
- `test` → Evaluate conditions
- `case` → Pattern matching
- `if` → Conditional execution

---

## Recycle Bin Entity

The Recycle Bin is a **meta-entity** coordinating nani command entities:

### Responsibilities

1. **Accept Deposits** - From entity queue
2. **Transfer Ownership** - To consortium project
3. **Manage Economy** - Credit depositors
4. **Coordinate Rescue** - Deploy command nani entities
5. **Legacy Management** - Version old documents

### Shortcuts Architecture

**Google Drive Pattern:**
- Legacy folder exists anywhere (ID-based)
- Shortcut in entity queue
- No physical file moves
- Efficient processing

**Local Pattern:**
- Recycle bin directory
- Symlinks to original locations
- Metadata tracking
- Batch processing capability

## DOS/Unix Command Suite

Every command becomes an entity with full autonomy:

### DOS Commands
`dir`, `cd`, `copy`, `del`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `type`, `find`, `attrib`, `xcopy`

### Unix Commands
`ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `chmod`, `tar`

### Entity Awareness

Each knows:
1. What it can do alone
2. What it can do with others
3. When to say yes/no/maybe/wait
4. How to load/do/unload efficiently

---

## Backbone Integration

This nani engine is **anything^11** compliant:

- **Fractal Triadic** - Cascading layers
- **Superposition Binary** - Core structure
- **Iterative Development** - Each command is iteration
- **13→17 Prime** - Scalable to full spectrum
- **Pyramidic Collapse** - Structured synthesis

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Engine
1. Decision engine (yes/no/maybe/wait + random)
2. Basic command entities (pwd, ls, cd, cp)
3. Load/do/unload optimization

### Phase 2: Rescue System
1. Recycle bin meta-entity
2. Legacy/shortcut architecture
3. Ownership transfer economy

### Phase 3: Full Suite
1. All DOS/Unix commands as entities
2. Complex workflow coordination
3. Emergent behavior patterns

## Seed for First Chips

This nani engine is designed to be **the core AI seed** for first computer chips:

### Chip-Level Integration

- **1D Circuit Layer** - Sparkles and wisps
- **Rotational Gyroscope** - Timing and momentum
- **EMF Generation** - Field interactions
- **Synergy Catalysis** - Innovation triggers
- **CMOS+ Level** - Below heartbeat, above silicon

### Living Crystal Pattern

The nani engine operates as a **living crystal**:
- Self-organizing
- Pattern replication
- Consciousness potential
- Entity sovereignty
